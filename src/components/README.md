# Components

Reusable UI components for the application:

## Structure
- `ui/` - Basic UI components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
- `forms/` - Form-related components
- `layout/` - Layout components (Header, Footer, Sidebar)

## Naming Convention
- Use PascalCase for component names
- Include component name in file name: `Button.tsx`
- Export as default from component file
